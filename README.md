# Soul Bound Protocol

A decentralized, privacy-preserving framework for creating digital identities that are strongly anchored to real-world verification events. The protocol enables multiple interoperable implementations to generate and manage non-transferable identity tokens while maintaining strong security guarantees and economic incentives.

## Core Goals

- **Sybil Resistance**: Ensure each identity corresponds to a unique, real-world individual through verification requirements and economically-backed sponsorships
- **Privacy Preservation**: Protect sensitive verification data using zero-knowledge proofs
- **Interoperability**: Define a clear, implementation-agnostic protocol specification
- **Extensibility**: Separate core verification mechanics from application-specific identity interpretation
- **Economic Alignment**: Introduce token-based stakes and slashing conditions to align incentives toward honest behavior

## Key Features

- Non-transferable identity tokens on distributed ledgers
- Standardized, auditable sponsorship stakes
- Decoupled application-specific identity interpretation
- Economic incentives (staking, slashing) to deter fraud
- Privacy-preserving verification mechanisms
- Decentralized validation with quorum-based consensus

## Design Principles

The protocol is designed to make it economically and practically infeasible to create fraudulent identities at scale, while still allowing for legitimate identity creation through:

- Verification requirements that cannot be easily automated
- Economic stakes that make fraud costly
- Decentralized validation that prevents single points of failure
- Privacy-preserving mechanisms that protect user data
